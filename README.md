# PyBanner

#### M.Sython

hello guys!

linux has a banner maker with ASCII art.using it with this command:

```bash
$ banner text
```

But this tool does not exist in Windows.So I decided to make it

The tool I made is much better. Because:

1- This tool can create banner with colors (blue,red,green,yellow,white)

2-linux's banner maker,Makes text with a # only.But this tool builds with all the characters. As a result, it will have a better shape

3-this is open source

To Use:
----------

1-download or copy file

2-go to cmd and install modules:

```bash
$ pip install termcolor2
```

```bash
$ pip install pyfiglet
```

3-run code and using it!

i hope to like this

goodbye!
